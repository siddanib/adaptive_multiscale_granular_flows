# An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows

This repository has the code used to carry out the work in the [manuscript](arXiv link)

## Python virtual environment

This work was carried out using GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter.
Sample script to create the environment is available [here](/nersc_perlmutter_specific/build_py_venv.sh)

## Installing PyLAMMPS into the environment using CMake

Assuming that we are inside ``lammps`` directory and the virtual environment is **active**.

```
   # Create a sub-folder named build
   mkdir build
   # Move into it
   cd build
   cmake -D BUILD_MPI=yes -D PKG_GRANULAR=on -D PKG_EXTRA-FIX=on -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV ../cmake
   # Create the shared library version
   make -j 10
   # Python installation
   make install-python
```

## Installing pyAMReX into the environment using CMake

Assuming that we are inside ``pyAMReX`` directory and the virtual environment is **active**.

```
   cmake -S . -B build -DAMReX_SPACEDIM="1;2;3" -DAMReX_MPI=ON \
   -DAMReX_GPU_BACKEND=CUDA -DpyAMReX_amrex_src=/path/to/amrex
   # compile & install, here we use four threads
   cmake --build build -j 4 --target pip_install
```

## Compiling and running instructions for incflo

Use the GNUMake file in a setup folder to compile ``incflo`` (continuum solver).

**Ensure to build both incflo and pyAMReX using the same AMReX version.**
